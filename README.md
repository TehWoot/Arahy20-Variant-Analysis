# Introduction

A variant analysis was conducted on QTL qPSIIB10. The qPSIIB10 region has been shown as a locus possibly conferring aflatoxin resistance in peanut and is present across multiple environments. In the present study, resistant and susceptible varieties, ICG1471 and Florida-07, were mapped to cultivated peanut, Tifrunner, to identify candidate genes possibly contributing to aflatoxin resistance.
