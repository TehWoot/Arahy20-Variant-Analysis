# Introduction

A variant analysis was conducted on QTL *qPSIIB10*. The *qPSIIB10* region has been shown as a locus possibly conferring aflatoxin resistance in peanut and is present across multiple environments. In the present study, resistant and susceptible varieties, ICG1471 and Florida-07, were mapped to cultivated peanut, Tifrunner, to identify variants and candidate genes possibly contributing to aflatoxin resistance.

# Mapping and Variant Calling

The HiFi sequences of Florida-07 and ICG1471 were mapped to TifrunnerV2 using minimap2 2.26. Variants were called using samtools
